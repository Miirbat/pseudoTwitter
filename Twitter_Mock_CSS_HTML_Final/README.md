## Mid-Module JS Project

Today we are going to spend the day just creating a product. That means no tests, no specific directions...just (hopefully) joyful creation. Have fun with it. Creating amazing things is the reason we are all here.

### The Goal

 * Use Javascript and jQuery to manipulate the DOM
 * Integrate with a third party API
 * Understand the amount of work required to build even a single feature of a website.

### The Problem 

Your goal is to recreate a super simplified version of one of your favorite websites. You'll be using the API provided by the backend, and your new found Javascript, jQuery and AJAX skills to create the front end. 

Your final product will be just some HTML and Javascript!

#### Finding an API

Once you understand which website you want to re-create, search around for that companies API. Read their documentation and make sure you can do, what you want to do with their API. In particular, we highly recommend trying to hit the API with Postman to make sure the data returned is what you expect. 

**A Note on CORS** Make sure your API supports either CORS or JSONP. Google around to ensure this. _If_ you can't find an API that you want to work with that supports one of these technologies you will have to disable CORS in your browser. To do this, close all Chrome browsers, open up a terminal and type `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir`.

**APIs to avoid**: Yelp, Facebook and anything Google. They are all crazy confusing. 

### Some Examples

 * The Followers page of twitter: https://twitter.com/followers
 * Foursquare Venue search: https://foursquare.com/search
 * Foursquare Lists browser: https://foursquare.com/jmburges/lists/created
 * Dribble Viewer: https://dribbble.com/shots?sort=views
